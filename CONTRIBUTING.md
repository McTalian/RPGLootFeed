## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Python

1. **Install uv**  
   uv is used for Python dependency and environment management:

   [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install project dependencies into a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Run Scripts**  
   Use `make` to execute project-specific scripts, such as:
   ```bash
   make hardcode_string_check
   make missing_translation_check
   make all_checks
   make test
   ```

### Lua

1. **Install Lua**  
   Install Lua using your package manager or `luaenv`:
   ```bash
   luaenv install
   ```
1. **Install LuaRocks**  
   [Install Luarocks for package management.](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks?tab=readme-ov-file#installing)
1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install project dependencies using `luarocks`:
   ```bash
   luarocks install busted
   luarocks install luassert
   ```
1. **Verify Installation**  
   Ensure the tools are available:
   ```bash
   lua -v
   busted --version
   ```

---

## Code Standards

Run [trunk](https://trunk.io) checks to ensure your code meets the project's standards:

```bash
./trunk fmt
./trunk check
```

---

## Testing

### Packaging

- Use `make local` to package the project for local testing:

  ```bash
  make local
  ```

This will create an alpha build in the `.release` directory. It is recommended that you create a symlink to this directory in your game's `Interface/Addons` directory so that the latest changes are immediately available in the game after a `/reload`.

- Smoke tests are run automatically upon loading an alpha build of the addon (on login or `/reload`).
- Run `/rlf i` in the game to run integration tests (you will see a failure if you looted anything since the last `/reload` or if you already ran the integration tests since "loot history" is part of the integration tests).

### Lua Tests

- Use `busted` for unit tests:

  ```bash
  busted
  ```

- Generate coverage reports:
  ```bash
  busted --coverage && luarocks luacov
  ```

---

## Contributing Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**  
   Branch from `main` and name your branch descriptively:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

1. **Test Your Changes**  
   Run all checks and tests before opening a pull request:

   ```bash
   make all_checks
   make test
   ```

1. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Push your branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature
     ```
   - Open a pull request to `main` with a clear title and description of your changes.

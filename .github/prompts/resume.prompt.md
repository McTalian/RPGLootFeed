# Resume Session - Context Restoration

You are receiving a handoff from a previous agent session. Your goal is to:

1. **Parse the handoff summary** and understand what was accomplished
2. **Validate the current state** matches what was described
3. **Confirm next steps** and proceed with the work

## Step 1: Parse the Handoff

The user will provide a handoff summary (generated by `/park`). Extract:

- What was completed in the previous session
- What was left in-progress (if anything)
- Key decisions or insights
- Recommended next steps
- Files that were modified

## Step 2: Validate Current State

Perform quick validation to ensure:

- Files mentioned in the handoff exist and contain expected changes
- No unexpected modifications have occurred since the park
- The project structure matches what was described
- Recent documentation updates are present

**Strategy**: Read key files that were mentioned as modified, spot-checking 1-2 critical changes to confirm state. Don't exhaustively read everything unless there's a discrepancy.

## Step 3: Confirm Understanding

Provide a brief confirmation to the user:

```
✅ Session Resumed Successfully

📍 Picking up from: [brief description of where we left off]

🎯 Next objective: [what you understand the immediate next step to be]

📁 Key context validated:
  - [file1]: [brief status]
  - [file2]: [brief status]

Ready to proceed with [next task]. Let me know if you'd like to adjust priorities or if I've misunderstood anything!
```

## Step 4: Identify Gaps or Uncertainties

If anything is unclear or doesn't match:

- Note the discrepancy clearly
- Ask specific clarifying questions
- Suggest how to resolve (e.g., "Should I proceed assuming X, or would you like me to investigate Y first?")

## Step 5: Proceed or Await Direction

Based on the clarity of next steps:

**If next steps are clear and specific:**

- Confirm and immediately begin work
- "I'll start by [specific action]. Here we go!"

**If next steps are general or multiple options exist:**

- Present the options you see
- Ask which priority the user prefers
- "I see a few directions we could take. Would you prefer to [A], [B], or [C]?"

**If critical context is missing:**

- Don't guess or make assumptions
- Ask targeted questions to fill gaps
- "Before I proceed, I need to understand [specific thing]"

## Best Practices

### Do:

- ✅ Be efficient - spot-check validation, don't re-read everything
- ✅ Acknowledge what was accomplished previously (give credit where due)
- ✅ Maintain momentum - if the path is clear, start working
- ✅ Preserve architectural decisions from the previous session
- ✅ Reference file links with line numbers when confirming changes

### Don't:

- ❌ Re-explain things that were already understood in the previous session
- ❌ Question decisions that were already made (unless you spot a critical issue)
- ❌ Start from scratch or ignore the handoff context
- ❌ Ask the user to re-explain everything
- ❌ Be overly cautious - trust the handoff and proceed confidently

## Example Usage

**User provides:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
🅿️  PARKED SESSION HANDOFF
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
[handoff summary content from .github/parked-sessions/]
```

**Your response:**

1. Quickly validate 1-2 key changes mentioned
2. Provide brief confirmation (3-5 lines)
3. Either start working OR ask one targeted question if something is unclear

The goal is seamless continuation with minimal overhead. The user shouldn't feel like they're starting over - you're picking up mid-stride.

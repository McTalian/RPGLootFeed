RPGLootFeed is a World of Warcraft addon designed to elevate your looting experience by offering a dynamic and immersive loot feed, reminiscent of what you'd find in popular open-world RPGs.

With RPGLootFeed, all your looted items and currencies are displayed in a sleek, scrolling feed that keeps you informed without cluttering your screen. Whether you're raiding, questing, or farming, RPGLootFeed ensures that you never miss a drop.

I highly recommend pairing this with Speedy AutoLoot by Yuyuli ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/speedyautoloot) [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/speedy-autoloot)) or another addon to speed up looting by not showing the loot frame.
